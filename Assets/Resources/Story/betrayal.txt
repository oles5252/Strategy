I have been offered power beyond anything I've ever known, and with it I will ensure no further harm comes to this land. Tisiphone: Stop this foolishness at once! You have betrayed me, your people, but worst of all yourself. Iphi: Watch yourself dear, we don't know what he's capable of. Sisyphus: Listen to your friends! I do not wish to harm you, but if you choose to fight me, it will not end well. All of this is to protect you! Tisiphone: Don't delude yourself. I was unsure, but now I am certain - I must cut you down.
