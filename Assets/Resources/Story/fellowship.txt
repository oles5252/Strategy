Tisiphone: The enemy comes right to our doorstep! I should eavesdrop ere they know of my presence. Garb: How inviting this village is! Gorb: Aye a bit of remodling and it could even be comfortable. Gurd: Arg! Garb: And so sorely undefended! Gorb: Seems the men left for the skirmish. Garb: Seems so. Gurd: Bah! Gorb: Folly indeed! Even they cannot resist the Conqueror's influence. Gorb: Suppose there's no royalty here. Garb: S'pose not. Tisiphone: The enemy is hunting royalty?

Garb: From the mountains? Tisiphone: I've been spotted, alas I fear I cannot defeat all three on my own. Brother, it seems I will perish in battle sooner than you had feared.
