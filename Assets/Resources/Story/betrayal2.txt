Tisiphone: Alas it has come to this, the horror of war. My life for thine. How could you betray us? Sisyphus: The Conqueror showed me... visions of your death... over and over... I wanted to save you... to protect you... Dartfoot: This is the power of the Conqueror, he is not conqueror in name alone. He is able to conquer desires - your brother had the desire to protect you, whether misguided or not, and the Conqueror used that to sway him to evil deeds.
