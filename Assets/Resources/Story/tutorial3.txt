Sisyphus: As always your skills cease to impress! The village is sure to be in good hands in the coming days. Tisiphone: Brother, will you hold firm to your decision to leave me here? As you said, I am your equal in swordplay. The great alliance has need of all the men we can muster. Sisyphus: It is not your swordplay in question! You are certainly as brave and skilled as any man, but I would rather perish than see you on the front lines. Tisiphone: You would perish! Oh brother, you are narrow sighted indeed, for I will perish if I stay behind. Sisyphus: I am sorry, but I foresee that there will be need of you here. The evil influence will soon enough reach even our small village. Please hearken to my words - the front lines are not your place.
